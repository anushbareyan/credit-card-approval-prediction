# Credit Card Approval Prediction

This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting credit card approval decisions using a variety of techniques, including HyperGBM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost, and XGBoost.It is a group assignment for the Data Mining course.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust model that can accurately predict whether a credit card application will be approved based on the applicant's information. The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing highly correlated features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Implementing target encoding for categorical variables and standardizing numerical features.
3. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV and HyperGBM for tuning hyperparameters and selecting the best models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using ROC AUC, confusion matrix, and feature importance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about applicants and their credit card approval status. The data includes various features such as industry, ethnicity, gender, marital status, and financial details.
